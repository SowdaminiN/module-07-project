Ideally here we are creating, monitoring and alerting system for temperature-sensitive environments, such as a smoker and food smoking processes, using various callback scripts from the cosumer part.
If smoker temp decreases by 15 F or more in 2.5 min (or 5 readings) --> smoker alert!
If food temp change in temp is 1 F or less in 10 min (or 20 readings) --> food stall alert!
